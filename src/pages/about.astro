          <p class="lead">Our ambition is to create more female tech billionaires.</p>
          <p>We believe the next generation of unicorns can and will be built by women. There is persistent underrepresentation of female technical talent, which is too often overlooked despite its immense potential, and we think this talent is capable of disrupting the industry completely.</p>
          <p>TTB enables women in highly technical fields to launch their startup through our community, events, & accelerator programme, running every summer.</p>

        <h2>why we exist</h2>
        <p class="lead">Female-founded startups consistently outperform startups with all-male teams, yet receive a fraction of the venture funding:</p>
        <ul class="origin-list">
          <li>Studies show that when presented with identical pitches, both male and female investors rate those pitched by men more favourably.</li>
          <li>Both male and female investors rate identical pitches more highly when they were told a male investor had already invested in the company (compared to a female investor).</li>
          <li>When pitching, male founders are more often asked “promotion” questions focused on what might go right, compared to female founders who are asked "prevention" questions focused on what might go wrong; and in comparable companies, entrepreneurs who were asked primarily “prevention” questions raise an average of seven times less than founders who were mostly asked “promotion” questions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead">We believe in creating an entirely new pipeline for backing exceptional female founders, from idea stage to pre-seed all the way through to exit or IPO.</p>

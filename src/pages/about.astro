        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <div class="mission-content">
          <p class="lead">We exist because technical women deserve better. Better accelerators. Better investors. Better networks. Better spaces.</p>
          <p>Most accelerators weren't built for technical founders. They were built for hustlers, sales people, and visionaries who delegate the "hard stuff" to their CTOs. That model works for some. It doesn't work for founders who are the technical founders—the ones writing code, architecting systems, and making product decisions based on deep technical knowledge.</p>
          <p>We're changing that. The Tech Bros is the first accelerator designed from the ground up for technical women. No adaptions. No compromises. Just a program that actually understands what you're building and why it matters.</p>

    <!-- Origin Story -->
    <section class="origin">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2023 by technical women who'd been through every accelerator, program, and network out there. We were tired of:</p>
        <ul class="origin-list">
          <li>Being told to "find a technical co-founder" when we were the technical co-founder</li>
          <li>Mentors who couldn't read our code or understand our architecture decisions</li>
          <li>Investors asking basic technical questions that revealed they didn't get what we were building</li>
          <li>Programs designed for non-technical founders, with us as an afterthought</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So we built something different. Something that assumes you know what you're doing. Something that amplifies technical excellence instead of questioning it.</p>

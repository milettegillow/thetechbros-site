We will only send you outreach and marketing messages if you have given us your consent to do so. You can withdraw your consent at a later date by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the footer of our outreach and marketing emails or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:team@thetechbros.io">team@thetechbros.io</a>.

          <h3>International Transfers of your personal information.</h3>
          <p>The personal information we collect may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the jurisdiction you are in where we and our third-party service providers and partners have operations, including in the United States. We will ensure that these international transfers of your personal information are made pursuant to appropriate safeguards, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>ensuring that the personal information is only transferred to countries recognised by the UK Secretary of State as offering an equivalent level of protection as compared to the level of protection in the country you are located; or</li>
            <li>the transfer is to a third party who uses appropriate safeguards in respect of the processing in question, included but not limited to the standard contractual clauses, which are recognised as offering adequate protection for the rights and freedoms of data subject, as adopted by the UK Secretary of State.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We will take appropriate steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with applicable law and this privacy notice regardless of where it is processed. If you wish to enquire further about the safeguards we use, please contact us using the details set out at the end of this privacy notice.</p>

          <h2>9. YOUR RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
          <p>In accordance with applicable privacy law you have the following rights in respect of your personal information that we hold:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Right of access.</strong> You have the right to obtain: confirmation of whether, and where, we are processing your personal information; information about the categories of personal information we are processing, the purposes for which we process your personal information and information as to how we determine applicable retention periods; information about the categories of recipients with whom we may share your personal information; and a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</li>
            <li><strong>Right of portability.</strong> You have the right, in certain circumstances, to receive a copy of the personal information you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format that supports re-use, or to request the transfer of your personal information to another person.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to rectification.</strong> You have the right to obtain rectification of any inaccurate or incomplete personal information we hold about you without undue delay.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to erasure.</strong> You have the right, in some circumstances, to require us to erase your personal information without undue delay if the continued processing of that personal information is not justified.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to restriction.</strong> You have the right, in some circumstances, to require us to limit the purposes for which we process your personal information if the continued processing of the personal information in this way is not justified, such as where the accuracy of the personal information is contested by you.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent.</strong> Where we rely on your consent for processing your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent. Withdrawal of your consent will not affect the lawfulness of the processing of your personal information before you withdrew your consent.</li>
            <li>You have a right to object to any processing based on our legitimate interests. There may, depending on the particular circumstances, be compelling reasons for continuing to process your personal information despite your objection, and we will assess and inform you if that is the case. You can object to marketing activities for any reason.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you wish to exercise one of these rights, please contact us using the contact details at the top of this privacy notice.</p>
          <p>We will not charge you a fee for complying with your request to exercise one of these rights, other than where the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive (such as if you submit a number of repeated requests), in which case we may charge you a reasonable fee to cover our administrative costs.</p>
          <p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint to your national data protection authority. If you are in the UK, your local data protection authority is the Information Commissioner's Office, which can be contacted using the details at <a href="https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/</a>.
